# [WIP] callable-decorator

Makes any ES class instance callable as function, allowing you to set magic method `[SYMBOL_CALL]`.

# Usage

```md
~~yarn add callable-decorator~~
```

```js
import { callable, SYMBOL_CALL } from 'callable-decorator';

@callable
class Decorated {
  constructor(a, b) {
    this.a = a;
    this.b = b;
  }

  [SYMBOL_CALL]() {
    return 50;
  }
}

const canBeCalled = new Decorated(1, 2);

console.log(canBeCalled()); // 50
```

# Test

```console
yarn build
yarn test
```

# Difference from `digital-flowers/classy-decorator`

[digital-flowers/classy-decorator](https://github.com/digital-flowers/classy-decorator/) allows you to make class constructor callable without `new`, while `callable-decorator` makes already instanciated object callable as function.

## Q. Is instance of the decorated class really `instanceof` original class?

Yes and no. Look at `/test/index.js`.

```js
@callable
class A {
  [SYMBOL_CALL]() {
    return 10;
  }
}

// ðŸ™†
console.log(new A instanceof A) // true
class B extends A {  } // does not throw error.

// ðŸ¤” 
console.log(new A) // function() { return 10; }, not class instance
```

## Q. Would you add the feature like `classy-decorator` to this library ?

No.
